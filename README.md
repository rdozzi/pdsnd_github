## Bikeshare Analysis from Motivate Data Sets

## Description
This project is one of several projects from Udacity's Introduction to Data Science using Python. The program specifically analyzes the bikeshare datasets of three different cities: 
* New York City
* Chicago
* Washington

The program asks the user select a city, either one or all months between January and June, and either one or all days for analysis. The program then computes the following:

####User Choices & Start Time Information
1) The **city** you chose
2) Either the **month you selected** OR the **month with the most bike uses**
3) Either the **day you selected** OR the **day with the most bike uses**
4) The most common **start hour time range** in the selected day.

####Station Information
1) The most common **start and end bike stations**.

####Trip Durataion Information
1) **Total travel time** based on your choices of month and day.
2) **Average travel time** based on your choices of month and day.

####User Information
1) **User type** count
2) **User (binary) gender** count
3) **Earliest, most recent, and most common** birth years among users
